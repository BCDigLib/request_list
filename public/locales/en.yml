        <p>
        Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br/>
        Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br/>
        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br/>
        And summer's lease hath all too short a date:<br/>
        Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br/>
        And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;<br/>
        And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br/>
        By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;<br/>
        But thy eternal summer shall not fade<br/>
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;<br/>
        Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,<br/>
        When in eternal lines to time thou growest:<br/>
        So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br/>
        So long lives this and this gives life to thee.
        </p>
